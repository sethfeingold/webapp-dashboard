 WebApp Dashboard (Treehouse Project 7)

Wow. This project was CHALLENGING. It took a bit of convincing myself not to submit for "meets expectations" on this one, but I felt like I would be doing myself a disservice to not pursue the more challenging aspects of this project. I decided that if I'm to seriously pursue coding, these are the things I'll certainly need to learn, and the mindset of stepping out of my comfort zone is something I should get used to.

All in all, I had a lot of fun with this one and it was rewarding seeing my bell icon come to life, and *finally* getting the localStorage settings working!
